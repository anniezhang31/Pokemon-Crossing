Say, I was wondering if you'd do a big favor for me, [PLAYER]. I've got this present for [VILLAGER], but I was thinking it'd be a better surprise if you delivered it for me. Especially if you sang a little song to go with it. Just kidding. You don't have to sing. But will you please deliver the present for me?
So [VILLAGER] left something at my place, and I was going to go find [Villager] to return it. But it's almost snack time. Do you think you could do it for me, [PLAYER]? I'd be so grateful!
Um, I have something I want to give to [VILLAGER], but I'm so hungry I can't move very far... Do you think you could make a delivery for me, [PLAYER]? Please?
I actually borrowed something from [VILLAGER] a really long time ago. It's been so long, I'm embarrassed to return it now. I'm sorry, but, uh, could you return it for me instead?
Man, today has been weird so far. [VILLAGER] told me about this thing, and, well... I sort of made it my mission to find it for them. I ran all over the place, and I finally tracked it down! But now I'm exhausted. Any chance you can deliver it for me, [PLAYER]?
So, uh, [PLAYER]... when you're gathering fruit, can you grab some for me too? Thing is, I got stung by a bee the other day... It's really had a negative impact on my tree-shakin' skills. I won't ask for much... Any kind of fruit will do. Sound good? I'm countin' on ya!
Oh, right! I wanted to ask you something. Umm... do you think you could bring me a piece of fruit? I'm cutting out candy and stabbing in fruit! I love it! But if I get it myself, I end up eating too much... So I always ask someone else to get it for me. Any kind will do! One piece of fruit - that's all I ask!
[CATCHPHRASE]... Say, I'm getting tired of saying [CATCHPHRASE] all the time. Do you think you could come up with something cooler for me to say, [CATCHPHRASE]?
I feel like I'm behind the times when I say [CATCHPHRASE] all the time. Do you think you can make me sound more hip? What are the kids saying nowadays?
[PLAYER], I've got a dilemma. I don't like my catchphrase anymore. [CATCHPHRASE] just isn't cutting it. Do you have any better ideas?
So on the spur of the moment the other day, I sorta bought a [ITEM]... But to be honest, this isn't the sort of thing that really suits me, so I'm trying to unload this item now. Would you want it? Would you consider buying it for [NUMBER] Bells?
